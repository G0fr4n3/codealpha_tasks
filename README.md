# Internship Tasks - CodeAlpha

**Intern Name:** Malek Ghofrane

**Domain:** Data Science

This repository contains the three primary projects completed during my Data Science internship at CodeAlpha, focusing on classical machine learning, data analysis, and predictive modeling.

## ⚠️ Important Note on Dependencies

All projects are implemented in Jupyter Notebook format. The required Python libraries and dependencies (e.g., Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib) can be found listed in the **first cell** of the respective Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) file.

## 📂 Repository Structure

### [Project 1: Iris Flower Classification](./Iris_Flower_Classification)
**Objective:** Train a machine learning model (e.g., K-Nearest Neighbors) to accurately classify Iris flowers into their species based on sepal and petal measurements.
- **Format:** Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`)
- **Key Outcome:** Achieved high classification accuracy ($>95\%$).
- **Status:** ✅ Completed

### [Project 2: Unemployment Analysis with Python](./Unemployment_Analysis)
**Objective:** Perform data cleaning, exploration, and visualization of unemployment rate data to identify trends, seasonal patterns, regional disparities, and investigate the specific impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on employment rates in India.
- **Format:** Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`)
- **Key Outcome:** Identified the massive volatility spike during the April 2020 lockdown and provided policy-relevant insights on stabilizing the labor market.
- **Status:** ✅ Completed

### [Project 3: Car Price Prediction with Machine Learning](./Car_Price_Prediction)
**Objective:** Utilize a regression model (Linear Regression) to predict used car prices based on features like brand goodwill, present price, and mileage, and rigorously evaluate the model's performance and suitability for real-world valuation.
- **Format:** Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`)
- **Key Outcome:** Developed a model capable of predicting car prices with a low Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), demonstrating strong application in automated pricing.
- **Status:** ✅ Completed
